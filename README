This is a fork of openssh/openssh-portable, and a port of 
OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Windows.

Note that OpenSSH for Windows uses Github for bug reporting and 
patch/pull-request management.

Instructions to report bus for openssh/openssh-portable are here:

See https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#7.5p1 for the release

- Thanks to HARUYAMA Seigo <haruyama@unixuser.org>

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's sample
implementation with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to
external libraries), all known security bugs fixed, new features
reintroduced and many other clean-ups.  OpenSSH has been created by
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
and Dug Song. It has a homepage at https://www.openssh.com/

This contains autoconf support, PAM support, and EGD[1]/PRNGD[2] support. 

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

OpenSSH depends on Zlib[3], OpenSSL[4] and optionally PAM[5].

There is now several mailing lists for openssh/openssh-portable. Please
refer to https://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please use github to submit bug reports and pull requests.  
Code contribution are welcomed, but please follow the OpenBSD
style guidelines[6].

Please refer to the "Releases" tab to install OpenSSH on your 
Windows system.

Miscellania -

This version of OpenSSH is based upon openssh/openssh-portable, which in 
turn is based on code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS repository, which 
in turn was based on the last free sample implementation released by 
Tatu Ylonen.
